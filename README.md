Backup Operator
===

[![Artifact Hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/backup-operator)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=backup-operator)

Kubernetes Go operator that creates and restores any backups.

Operator controls creation and **restoration** of backups. You create *BackupStorage* that will be used for storing backups generated by *BackupRuns*, while BackupRuns are created on schedule according to *BackupSchedule*.

## Annotations

Look for files named *annotations.go* across sources. It is guaranteed that you will find all possible annotations and documentation.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

If you already have KIND installed, you can easily create and delete cluster using [task](https://taskfile.dev).

```shell
task src:create
```

Here you will find other tasks available

```shell
task --list-all
```

After you run kind_create, kubeconfig.yaml will be created in current directory.

Minio will be published on `localhost:9000` (S3 API) and `localhost:9001` (Web UI). Local Docker registry will be published on `localhost:5000`. Make sure these ports are available on localhost.

Now, you can install CRDs.

```shell
task crds:install
```

Now you can either launch the application with go (but without webhooks)...

```shell
task go:run
```

...or deploy it to the kind cluster.

```shell
task chart:run
```

Once both database and storage are ready, continue with deploying our CRD. Check [samples](config/samples/_v1_backupschedule.yaml) for more details.

```shell
kubectl apply -f config/samples/99_common
kubectl apply -f config/samples/10_encryption_compression
```

## Description

// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f config/samples/
   ```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

   ```sh
   make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/backup-operator:tag
   ```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

   ```sh
   make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/backup-operator:tag
   ```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

   ```sh
   make install
   ```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

   ```sh
   make run
   ```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
